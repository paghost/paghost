 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paghost
 
 Working on a python program to find password of pcap files.
 
 Looking at pwd8.py and letters.txt and the 3 pictures from my notebook to give you an idea of my intentions
 
 trying to sequence the variables to get every possible combination.. seems so tedious i feel like there is an easy way i just havent found it yet.
 
 Any help would be appreciated ,, thank you
