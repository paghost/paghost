 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paghost
 
 Working on a python program to find password of pcap files.
 
 First step is import-pass.py which takes password lists and sorts them into 2letter, 3letter, 4letter and so on... text files
 
 I tried using 2 different methods to sort the files but end up getting all 2 letter words in the 3 letter.txt and 3 letter words in 4letter.txt and so on
 
 Any help would be appreciated ,, im a n00b so thank you
